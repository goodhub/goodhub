Thank you for wanting to take part in building GoodHub, we appreciate your interest and thank you in advance for contributing to this project!

We want to make sure we can get you started right away so you can:
* Look through our contributing documentation [WIP]
* Have a look at our current list of “good first contribution” issues
* Book a call in with one of our volunteer developers here to get you set up and ask your questions. [Pick a slot here.](https://cal.com/changesbyjames/getting-started)

As one our volunteer developers, we have two ways of rewarding you for your time:
* Swag! A rotating selection of standard tech swag that you can stick, wear or otherwise rock.
* As great experience working in open source and a reference on your CV. If you become a regular contributor we would be happy to be a phone reference for you.
